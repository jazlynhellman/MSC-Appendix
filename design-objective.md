You and a small group of peers have been asked to work together and design a new tool to help support the inclusion of developers, designers, and end-users of
free, libre, and open-source software (FLOSS) in addressing usability issues of that type of software.

Your objective is to work together to (a) identify a specific problem facing the inclusion of different stakeholders to achieve usable FLOSS and (b) design a 
concept to resolve the problem. As a team, create a written design pitch that illustrates the design concept and explains any relevant details and decisions. 
Some elements for you to consider including in your design pitch (you do not have to follow this
strictly) are:

* The problem statement
* Key features
* Why decisions were made
* How the tool will benefit the users
* Visual and external materials (i.e., sketches, mockups, prototypes, important links, etc.)
