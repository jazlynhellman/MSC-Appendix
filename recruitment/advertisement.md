Hello, I am a part of a team of researchers from McGill University and Polytechnique Montreal conducting
studies to understand and support the usability of free, libre, and open-source software (FLOSS). We are 
holding a design workshop-based study where participants will work together as a team to create the conceptual 
design of a tool that will improve the process to address usability of FLOSS. We are looking for participants who are 
(1) developers who contributed code to FLOSS in the past three months, (2) designers who contributed to the design or
usability aspects of FLOSS in the past three months, and/or (3) end-users who have provided feedback at least once. 
Participation in our study will help inform researchers to improve inclusion and accessibility for open-source usability later. 
The study will consist of an approximately three-hour synchronous design workshop via Microsoft Teams. You will receive a 
compensation of \$60 for participating in the study. If you are interested in participating, please fill out this form:

EMAIL. Looking forward to hearing from you!
